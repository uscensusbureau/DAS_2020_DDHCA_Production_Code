Introduction to Tumult Core
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Tumult Core is a collection of composable components for implementing
algorithms to perform differentially private computations. The design of Tumult Core
is based on the design proposed in the `OpenDP White Paper
<https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/files/opendifferentialprivacy/files/opendp_white_paper_11may2020.pdf>`_,
and can automatically verify the privacy properties of algorithms constructed
from Tumult Core components. Tumult Core is scalable, includes a wide variety of components,
and supports multiple privacy definitions.

Intended Users
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This library is intended to be used by data scientists and programmers who are familiar with differential privacy.

New users probably want to start with the :ref:`installation instructions`.
